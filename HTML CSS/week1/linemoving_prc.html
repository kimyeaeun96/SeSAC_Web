        <div>“As I relax on the sofa and gaze around 
            a room a thought hits me: this is exactly the place I’ve been looking for all my life. 
            A little hideaway in some sinkhole somewhere. I’d always thought of it as a secret, 
            imaginary place, and can barely believe that it actually exists. 
            I close my eyes and take a breath, and wonder of it all settles over me 
            like a gentle cloud.”</div>
